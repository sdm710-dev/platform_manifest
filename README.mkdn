DerpFest
==============

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the DerpFest trees, use a command like this:

```bash
repo init -u git://github.com/sdm710-dev/platform_manifest.git -b ten
```
Then to sync up:
```bash
repo sync --force-sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle
```

Building the source
---------------

The source at DerpFest is well configured for building.

```bash
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch derp_device-userdebug
mka kronic
```

## Help from other devices ##

Look, my device doesn't have FOD, so I couldn't add and test the FOD features myself. The same happens with Notch stuff, so if you want to add tweaks, features or help me to optimize the ROM, you can make pull request and help me out, will be really appreciated.


## Maintaining Authorship ##

Please make sure if you submit a patch/fix from another ROM that you maintain authorship.
This is very important to not only us but to the entire open source community. It's what keeps it going and encourages more developers to 
contribute their work.

If you manually cherry pick a patch/fix please add the original author prior to pushing to our gerrit.
This task is very easy and is usually done after you commit a patch/fix locally.

i.e - Once you type in "git commit -a" the commit message and you have saved it, type in the following:

```bash
git commit --amend --author "Author <email@address.com>"
```

So it should look like this once you get all author's information:

```bash
git commit --amend --author "Shreesha <shreeshu10@gmail.com>"
```
